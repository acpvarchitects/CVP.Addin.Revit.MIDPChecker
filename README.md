This Revit add-in verifies the consistency between the drawing names listed in the MIDP (Master Information Delivery Plan) and the actual files exported in a designated delivery folder. 
It cross-checks file names and supports multiple document formats, including models, ensuring compliance across all project deliverables.

The check extends to subfolders and generates a TXT report (it will be saved in the same folder of the MIDP) detailing:
- Drawings listed in the MIDP but missing in the delivery folder
- Files found in the delivery folder but not listed in the MIDP

This automated verification helps streamline project documentation, reducing errors and improving delivery accuracy.
